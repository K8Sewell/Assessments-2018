#### 1. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  
The lectures really helped explain the why behind what the code was doing.  I could copy paste and troublshoot to get stuff working.  Before the lectures why the code was working was a complete mystery.  I really appreciated the detail and time spent on them.
